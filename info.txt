Deploy a Contract (ICO)
    USe 18 Decimal
    *** Message object has: value, sender, txHash
    *** Events are IMP: No one would know what's happening (esp (etherScan won't pickup those Txs)
    *** constant modifier is useful: Prevents memory allocation to the value it represents
        (Never stave this value in Memory. Just reference the Hash because contract already has it)
    view identifier: On similar lines view is used

    *** BIG THING to Remember is, WALLET doesn't store TOKENS, SmartContract Does (only mapping),
        So if the contract dies, Tokens are lost
        It's nothing but Mapping of walletAddress => token amount value

    Transfer Ethers when function () payable public is called
            address.send(amt)
        Use transfer()
            require (msg.value > 0);
            require(toAddress.transfer(msg.value));

         **********
         // if require fails then reverts all the state tx and all sub state txs.
         // So always put transfer with require at last
         **********
